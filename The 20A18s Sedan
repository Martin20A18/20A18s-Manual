Positioned between the standard base model and the performance-focused sport trim, the 20A18s balances luxury features with sensible engineering. The designation “20A18s” refers to a combination of the model year range (2018), a platform code (A-series), and a trim level (S for Sport/Luxury hybrid).

This model has become popular in both urban and suburban markets, offering reliability and comfort for commuters while packing in enough advanced technology and performance features to attract enthusiasts. Whether cruising on the highway or navigating city streets, the 20A18s delivers a refined and enjoyable driving experience.
